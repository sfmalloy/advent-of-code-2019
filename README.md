# Advent of Code 2019

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2019 in Python. There are two folders as the `3.10` folder requires features from Python 3.10 (specifically, Structural Pattern Matching). Old solutions from 2019 can be found in `3.8`. `3.8` only goes up to Day 17 and I won't be updating it any further. `3.10` I plan to (eventually) finish to Day 25. Usages for each folder are detialed in their respective README files.

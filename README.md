# Advent of Code 2019!!!

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2019. 
If you want to download for yourself, have Python 3 installed. I am running Python 3.8.0

**Running**
----------------------------------
Last year I tried to be fancy and the driver turned out to be
painful to read and way too complicated. This year I am keeping it simple,
because everything is in Python!

To run:

    $ cd DayXX
    $ python <num>.py < <num>.in

I'll do runtimes later if I get the time.

# Advent of Code 2019!!!

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2019.
If you want to download for yourself, compile using make and then run.

**Running**
----------------------------------
Last year I tried to be fancy and the driver turned out to be
painful to read and way too complicated. This year I am keeping it simple.

Compile:
    
    $ make

Change directory to given day:
    
    $ cd DayXX

Run the executable:
    
    $ ./DayXX

**Timings**
----------------------------------
I obtained times from my desktop running Arch Linux and g++ 9.2.0.  Parts 1 and 2 are run in the same run.

Day # | Time (in ms) | # of Lines
